* Look to PPTs for examples
# L1.1 - What is Machine Learning?

* Machine leanring is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by use of data
Ex: Weather, Face Recognition

## When and Why ML?
* Programming/labour fails
	* Scale/speed/cost of human labour
	* Inability to express rules using language
	* Dont know the exact rules transforming input to output
* Machine learning succes
	* lots of idea
	* some structural idea on the rules

# L1.2 - Data, Models and ML Task
## Data
* Data is a collection of vectors
* ![[Pasted image 20250515140222.png]]

Metadata: Data about the data

## Model:
* Mathematical simplification of reality
	* By definition are approximations
Eg: Ideal gas Model, Inverse square law, Cobb-Douglas model in economics

## Types of models in ML
* Predictive
	* Regression
	* Classification
* Probabilistic

## Learning Algorithms
Data -> Models
Choose from a collection of models but with different parameters, using data to get the best parameters

# L1.3 - Regression
## Notation

## Supervised learning
* Basically curve fitting
* Given {(x1, y1),...,(xn, yn)}

# L1.4 - Classification
* Classifies into categories (Either binary or multi)

# L1.5 - Unsupervised Learning, Dimensionality Reduction
## Unsupervised learning
* Clustering
## Dimensionality reduction
* Compression and Simplification

Model:
![[Pasted image 20250515150154.png]]
Goal of dimensional reduction is to come up with two algorithms, encoder and decoder


# L1.6 - Unsupervised Leaning: Density Estimation
## Probabilistic Model:
* scores different configurations of reality
